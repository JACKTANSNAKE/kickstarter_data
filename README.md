# Is Success on Kickstarter PureÂ Chance?
Analysis of Kickstarter Data - what makes a project successful?

## Installations
Python: v.3.6.3
Libraries Used: Sci-Kit Learn, Pandas, Numpy
Kaggle API (Data from: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects)

## Project Motivation
I wanted to investigate to see whether there are any trends that contribute to project success. Having a successful round of crowdfunding can make or break a career or dream. I want to try and find something that would help people get on the right track to raising money.

## File Descriptions
Jupyter Notebook File: kickstarter_data.ipynb
HTML File of Notebook:
Data: `ks-projects201612.csv`, `ks-projects201801.csv`

## Process

### Data Cleaning
There were two datasets that upon evalution turned out to be similar, except one also included data until 2018. Therefore I focused only on the 2018 dataset.
